			02/2020-07/2020	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>'Music generation system based on LSTM and GAN'<br>
			Led by Professor Xiaoxiang LIU, Assistant Dean of SISSE of Jinan University</b>
<li>Developed a lightweight artificial intelligence composition system</li>
<li>Referring to the Magenta project, using MIDI format files as the dataset, using the framework of Python and PyTorch, using LSTM network to learn the musical melody direction of the dataset, and using CGAN network to learn the accompaniment of the specified musical style</li>
<li>Conducting a blind questionnaire test, the result is that the music composed by the system is more than 80% similar to the music made by human</li>
